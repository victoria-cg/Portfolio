# Portfolio

## Description

This project entailed building a working projects portfolio to store and showcase my coding projects as well as include links to my contact information. It serves to consolidate my featured projects onto one page and to provide viewers with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages. The objective of this project was to practice skills with use of HTML, CSS, and especially responsiveness properties such as 'flex'.
